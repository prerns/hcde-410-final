This project will hope to uncover some trends that can reveal what makes a song successful using the Top Hits playlists by Spotify from the years 2010-2019

The data I will be using comes from kaggle and the data was extracted using spotify api. The columns I will be using are...
- **bpm:	Beats Per Minute - The tempo of the song**
- **nrgy:	Energy - How energetic the song is**
- **dnce:	Danceability - How easy it is to dance to the song**
- **live:	How likely the song is a live recording**
- **dur:	Duration of the song**
- **acous:	How acoustic the song is**
